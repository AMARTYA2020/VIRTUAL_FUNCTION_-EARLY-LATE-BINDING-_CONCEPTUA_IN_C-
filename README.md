/*
 HERE IN THIS PROGRAM ADDREESS OF OBJECT B IS PASSED TO A AND DISPLAY FUNCTION IS CALLED BUT THE OUTPUT WE GET IS THE METHOD DISPLAY
 OF BASE CLASS "A" INSTEAD OF CLASS "B"
 THIS IS NOT ANY KIND OF AMBIGUITY..........HERE COMES THE ROLE OF LATE AND EARLY BINDING


 CONSIDER THE BELOW PRAGMATIC SCENARIO FOR BETTER GRASP OF THE CONCEPT::
 Assume that you are a chef and you have your daily routine of cooking various receipes every month since you are habituated....you ignore
 time constraint because the dish to be prepared is well known beforehand  --> ANALOGUS TO LATE BINDING

 But if the chef is supposed to take part in any cooking competation then the time period is the major defining criteria as the dish to be
 prepared in the competation is not known --> ANALOGUS TO EARLY BINDING:
